# 🔑 Dark Protocol - Program Information

> ⚠️ **SECURITY NOTICE — leaked keypairs purged**
>
> Earlier revisions of this file pasted seed phrases and raw secret-key byte
> arrays for the two program-ID keypairs below. Those values were committed
> to a public GitHub repo and **must be considered permanently compromised.**
> They have been redacted from this file. The on-chain *upgrade authority*
> (`5m8qxm4j75VQCv34oUThE5QNbKJG7KHfd85NdK4dVagS`) was **not** in the leak —
> but the keypair for that authority is **currently unaccounted-for**, so the
> deployed devnet programs are effectively immutable until that key is found
> or fresh programs are deployed under new IDs.
>
> Going forward: never paste seed phrases, mnemonics, raw `solana-keygen`
> JSON byte arrays, or any private key material into a doc, comment, commit
> message, or chat. Keep keypairs in `.secrets/` (gitignored) or a hardware
> wallet / password manager. Public keys and program IDs are fine to document.

This document contains program deployment information: program IDs, on-chain
addresses, network deployment status, and configuration. **Private keys and
seed phrases are deliberately omitted.**

## 📋 Program IDs

### Network Deployment Status

| Program | Localnet | Devnet | Mainnet |
|---------|----------|--------|---------|
| **dark-protocol** | `3KWLFYco7T2rUZkzjSSthjHGmbWmo9HAsRmvupDTomGC` | ✅ **DEPLOYED** | Not Deployed |

## 🔐 Keypair Information

> Private keys, mnemonics, and raw `solana-keygen` JSON for these keypairs
> were previously committed to this repo and are now considered burned.
> They are **not** documented here. Store keypairs in `.secrets/` (gitignored),
> a hardware wallet, or a password manager — never in a doc.

### Dark Protocol Keypair

- **Program ID (public, on-chain):** `3KWLFYco7T2rUZkzjSSthjHGmbWmo9HAsRmvupDTomGC`
- **Local keypair file (do NOT commit):** `target/deploy/dark_protocol-keypair.json`
- **Status:** compromised by the prior leak; only useful for redeploying under the *same* program ID, which is risky to do given the leak.

### Shielded Wallet Keypair

- **Program ID (public, on-chain):** `4753b1cCrPzwr7taWWD8yrcM8dc98fTR7wCFdv1TsAbg`
- **Local keypair file (do NOT commit):** `target/deploy/shielded_wallet-keypair.json`
- **Status:** compromised by the prior leak; same caveat as above.

### Upgrade Authority

- **Address:** `5m8qxm4j75VQCv34oUThE5QNbKJG7KHfd85NdK4dVagS`
- **Status:** keypair currently **lost / unaccounted-for**. Until it is recovered, the deployed devnet programs cannot be upgraded or transferred. Plan accordingly: any future change requires either recovering this key or deploying fresh programs under new IDs.

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### Anchor.toml Configuration

The `Anchor.toml` file is configured with the following program IDs across all networks:

```toml
[programs.localnet]
dark_protocol = "3KWLFYco7T2rUZkzjSSthjHGmbWmo9HAsRmvupDTomGC"
shielded_wallet = "4753b1cCrPzwr7taWWD8yrcM8dc98fTR7wCFdv1TsAbg"

[programs.devnet]
dark_protocol = "3KWLFYco7T2rUZkzjSSthjHGmbWmo9HAsRmvupDTomGC"
shielded_wallet = "4753b1cCrPzwr7taWWD8yrcM8dc98fTR7wCFdv1TsAbg"

[programs.mainnet]
dark_protocol = "3KWLFYco7T2rUZkzjSSthjHGmbWmo9HAsRmvupDTomGC"
shielded_wallet = "4753b1cCrPzwr7taWWD8yrcM8dc98fTR7wCFdv1TsAbg"
```

### Program lib.rs Declaration

**dark-protocol/src/lib.rs:**
```rust

## ⚠️ Security Warnings

### Critical Information

🔴 **NEVER SHARE THESE FILES PUBLICLY:**
- `target/deploy/dark_protocol-keypair.json`
- `target/deploy/shielded_wallet-keypair.json`
- Seed phrases listed above

🔴 **THESE KEYPAIRS CONTROL THE PROGRAMS:**
- Anyone with access to these keypairs can upgrade the programs
- Store them securely in a password manager or hardware wallet
- Consider using a multisig for mainnet deployments

### Backup Recommendations

1. **Encrypted Backup:** Store keypairs in an encrypted backup
2. **Multiple Locations:** Keep copies in separate secure locations
3. **Access Control:** Limit who has access to these files
4. **Monitoring:** Set up alerts for program upgrades

## 🚀 Next Steps

### ✅ Devnet Deployment - COMPLETE!

1. ✅ Programs compiled successfully
2. ✅ Funded deployment wallet with SOL
3. ✅ Deployed to devnet successfully
4. ⏳ Verify on Solana Explorer (see links below)
5. ⏳ Test program instructions
6. ⏳ Update SDK with deployed program IDs

### For Mainnet (Future)

⚠️ **DO NOT deploy to mainnet yet. Required first:**
- Security audit by reputable firm
- ZK-SNARK circuit production implementation
- Threshold ElGamal SDK implementation
- Resolution of BPF stack warnings
- Comprehensive testing on devnet
- Community review

## 📝 Notes

- Programs use Anchor framework 0.30.0 (code) with CLI 0.32.1
- Both programs successfully compiled with latest fixes
- Keypairs generated with valid Base58 encoding
- All configuration files updated with correct IDs
- Ready for devnet deployment pending wallet funding
